abstract: "We present pytest-inline, the first inline testingframework  for  Python.  We  recently  proposed  inline  tests  tomake  it  easier  to  test  individual  program  statements,  but  thereis currently no framework-level support available for developersto  write  inline  tests  in  Python.  To  fill  this  gap,  we  design  andimplement  pytest-inline  as  a  pytest  plugin,  which  is  the  mostpopular Python testing framework. In pytest-inline, a developercan write inline tests by assigning test inputs to variablesin  the  target  statement  and  specifying  the  expected  outputs.Then,  pytest-inline  runs  each  inline  test  and  fails  if  the  targetstatementâ€™s  output  does  not  match  the  expected  result.  In  thispaper, we describe the design of pytest-inline, the testing featuresthat  it  provides,  and  the  intended  use  cases.  Our  evaluation  ofpytest-inline on the inline tests we wrote for 80 target statementsfrom 31 open-source Python projects shows that using it to runinline tests incurs negligible overhead, at 0.012x. pytest-inline isopen-sourced, and a video demo of pytest-inline can be found athttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZgiAxR_uJg."
